# Onitama Game Bot - Codingame

This project was done by **Nicol√°s Chareca** and **Pablo Carro Arcaya**.

This was a part of the subject Artificial Intelligence in the [Computer Science Major](https://www.unavarra.es/en/sites/grados/informatica-y-telecomunicacion/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion.html) in the [Public University of Navarre](https://www.unavarra.es/home), in which we were prompted to program a bot to play Onitama against other people's bots.

The bot uses the [Minmax Alpha-Beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) algorithm to find the best play each turn.

We landed on 48th place worldwide for this non time-bound challenge, as you can see [here](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/onitama/leaderboard) `(the number may've changed as this is a challenge anyone can enter anytime, look for 'Carro_Chareca').`
